 * @brief Creates a gradient texture using specified color stops and colors.

 * buffer and can be used for graphical rendering.
 *
 * @param stops_count The number of color stops provided.

 *              in the range [0.0, 1.0].
 * @param colors An array of color_var_t structures representing the colors at each stop.
 * @param texid The texture ID where the gradient will be rendered.
 *
 * @note The function performs a dry run to validate the stops and ensure correctness
 *       before rendering the gradient. It also ensures that the first and last stops
 *       are correctly handled.
 *
 * @warning The function assumes that the input arrays (stops and colors) are valid
 *          and properly allocated. Undefined behavior may occur if invalid pointers
